1. a function that returns the sum of two numbers

Casual Pseudocode

1. Given two numbers as parameters for the function.
2. perform addition operation on the two numbers.
3. store the result in a variable
4. return the result variable.


Formal Pseudocode

START

# Given two numbers as parameters for a function.

SET result variable = number1 + number 2

RETURN result

END


2. a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Casual Pseudocode:

1. Define the function to accept the array of strings.
2. set an iterator value to 0
3. declare a variable to store an empty string. Let's call it result.
4. define a WHILE loop to iterate through the array. The stopping condition is less than the length of the array.
5. result should be the sum of result and the current index value of the array.

Formal Pseudocode:

START

# Given an array of strings

SET result = ''
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of array

SET result = result + value within array at space "iterator"

iterator = iterator + 1;

RETURN result

END


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]


Casual

Given an array of integers.

create an array which contains no values. This is where we push the even elements of the original array.

Iterate through the original array.
 - If the index value is even, push the array value to the previously declared empty array.
 - Repeat the process for all elements through iteration.
 
return the resulting array.


Formal:

START

# Given an array of integers

Inside of a function,

SET newArray = [] 
FOR iterator = 0 and iterator < length of array
-IF iterator % 2 is 0
- newArray.push(array[iterator])

RETURN newArray

END
