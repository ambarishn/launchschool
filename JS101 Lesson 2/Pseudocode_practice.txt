1. a function that returns the sum of two numbers

Casual Pseudocode

1. Given two numbers as parameters for the function.
2. perform addition operation on the two numbers.
3. store the result in a variable
4. return the result variable.


Formal Pseudocode

START

# Given two numbers as parameters for a function.

SET result variable = number1 + number 2

RETURN result

END


2. a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Casual Pseudocode:

1. Define the function to accept the array of strings.
2. set an iterator value to 0
3. declare a variable to store an empty string. Let's call it result.
4. define a WHILE loop to iterate through the array. The stopping condition is less than the length of the array.
5. result should be the sum of result and the current index value of the array.

Formal Pseudocode:

START

# Given an array of strings

SET result = ''
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of array

SET result = result + value within array at space "iterator"

iterator = iterator + 1;

RETURN result

END


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]


Casual

Given an array of integers.

create an array which contains no values. This is where we push the even elements of the original array.

Iterate through the original array.
 - If the index value is even, push the array value to the previously declared empty array.
 - Repeat the process for all elements through iteration.
 
return the resulting array.


Formal:

START

# Given an array of integers

Inside of a function,

SET newArray = [] 
FOR iterator = 0 and iterator < length of array
-IF iterator % 2 is 0
- newArray.push(array[iterator])

RETURN newArray

END

4. a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

Given a string of characters.

parse the string to see if the given character is present or not.

if the character is not present, exit out of the loop.

if the character is present, see whether the character is repeated thrice. 

find the index value of the third occurence of the character using a string method

Formal:

START

Given a string with multiple letters 

SET count variable = 0
SET iterator to 0

WHILE iterator < string length
Increment count variable by 1 for every repetition
IF count variable = 3, 
PRINT the index of the third occurence of the character using last index method for string
ELSE
SKIP to the next iteration

PRINT the count

END


5. a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

Casual

Given two arrays of numbers

create a new empty array to host the values

iterate through both the arrays simultaneously. 

push the elements from each array one by one into the new array

print new array


Formal:

START

Given two arrays with some values

SET new empty array

FOR iterator < array1 length 
    push the array1[iterator] to empty array
    push the array2[iterator] to empty array

PRINT new array

END
